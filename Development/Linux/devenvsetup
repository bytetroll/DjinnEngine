*** Moved supported compiler from GCC to Clang on 1/14/2021
*** Current Clang version is 11




 - CMake configuration throws errors regarding 32-bit not beingsupported.

        Caused by improper CMake target configuration in CLion.  Go into settings, CMake
        and change the active target to debug64/release64.
        
- CMake is not using Clang as the active compiler

        Caused by improper CMake target/toolchain configuration.  Go into settings, toolchains
        and setup a Clang environment; ensure it is configured as default.  Also ensure that libc++
        is installed or Clang will fallback to using libgcc which has issues with the newest version
        of Clang.
